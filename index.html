                       <p> A current third year EE student at UBC.</p>
                       <p> Since you're here, why not check out some of my projects I made/contributed to?</p>
                       <p> I love Software Engineering, Electronics, and all the nerdy tech stuff you can think of.</p>
                       <p> Also of course, consider hiring me as I am a passionate, aspiring engineer that would love to make the world a better place :P </p>

                         <h1 >Coin Picking Robot</h1>
                         <div class="container">
                           <p> Below is a video of a super cool autonomous robot that picks up coins by itself, which was made with a team of five people. It is programmed in the C language, and uses STM32F051 ARM Cortex-M as its microcontroller.
                           We used PWM(pulse-width modulation) to control servo motors, and detects its perimeter wires and coins using a peak detector we built. The peak detector uses a copitts oscillator circuit (which of course we built ourselves), and whenever it is near AC current or a coin the frequency of <thead>
                             oscillator changes drastically. We then use the microcontroller to pick up the change in frequency and let the robot react accordingly. When the perimeter wire is detected, it reverses direction, and when it detects a coin, it picks up the coin.
                          </p>

                          <p>For our bonus, we incorporated a bluetooth module and included a separate mode in which we could choose either a remote control mode or an autonomous mode. In the remote control mode, we can use our smartphones to remotely control the robot and make up coins manually.
                          It also displays on the smart phone end every time a coin is picked up. In the autonomous mode, the robot turns off after exactly 20 coins.</p>

                          <p>For the most part, I was mainly in charge of microcontroller programming, alongside with some circuit building.</p>

                            <p>A beautiful game that lets you guess what color an RGB combination is. There is an easy mode and a hard mode, and is built using DOM manipulation. Colors are randomly generated every game.</p>
