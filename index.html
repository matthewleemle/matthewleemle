                       <h1 >About me</h1>
                       <p> A current third year EE student at UBC.</p>
                       <p> Since you're here, why not check out some of my projects I made/contributed to?</p>
                       <p> I love Software Engineering, Electronics, and all the nerdy tech stuff you can think of.</p>
                       <p> Also of course, consider hiring me as I am a passionate, aspiring engineer that would love to make the world a better place :P </p>

                         <h1 >Coin Picking Robot</h1>
                         <div>
                           <p> Below is a video of an autonomous robot made by a team of five people that picks up coins by itself. It is programmed in the C language and uses STM32F051 ARM Cortex-M as its microcontroller.
                           We used PWM(pulse-width modulation) to control servo motors, and it detects perimeter wires and coins using a peak detector we built. The peak detector uses a copitts oscillator circuit built using a breadboard. Whenever the robot is near AC current or a coin the frequency of <thead>
                             oscillator changes. We then use the microcontroller to pick up the change in frequency and let the robot react accordingly.
                          </p>

                          <p>For our bonus, we incorporated a bluetooth module and included a separate mode in which we could choose either a remote control mode or an autonomous mode. In the remote control mode, we can use a smartphone to remotely control the robot and choose to pick up coins manually.
                          It also displays on the smartphone's console log every time a coin is picked up. In the autonomous mode, the robot turns off after exactly 20 coins.</p>

                          <p>For the most part, I was mainly in charge of microcontroller programming, alongside with some circuit building.</p>
